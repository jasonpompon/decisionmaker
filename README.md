# Decision Maker

## 1) Goal
To create an app where, if users have a decision to make and they have some options the can't decide between them, they can post a question then other users can vote on these options to help the original poster to make the right decision.

## 2) Approach taken
The app was created using the RESTful approach

## 3) Technologies used
The app was made using Ruby and the activerecord library. I used psql to store the data and heroku to host the app online.

## 4) Unsolved problems / Work in progress
- Still haven't be able to prevent a user from voting twice on the same questions
- Letting users to add comments to the question
- When creating a new question to give them a category for easier future retrieval

## 5) Installation Instructions
I runs on any browser so no specific installation required. The only things is to create a new answer and to vote one has to register for an account. Unregistered users can only view the questions and answers but can't change them in any way.

## 6) Important links
